<h1> Infested </h1>
Infested is a WebGL 2D survival game developed in the Unity engine and coded in C#. The player is given a starter weapon to begin with and accumulates points by surviving for as long as possible against hordes of enemies. Points can be used to buy weapons and ammo as the game becomes progressively more difficult.
